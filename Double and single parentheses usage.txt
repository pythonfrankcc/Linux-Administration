#when to use double parentheses in linux bash scripting


>> in Linux bash scripting the use of double parentheses is for arithmetic evaluation and comparisons in conditional statements. Here are a few scenarios of the saeme:
a) Arithmetic comparisons
Allows for arithemetic comparisons within conditional statements
num1=5
num2=10
if (( $num1 < $num2 )); then
	echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
fi



b) Arithmetic operations
if (( $num2%2 == 0 )); then
	echo"$num2 is even"
fi



c) Increements and Decreements
num3 = 20

(( $num3++ ))

if (($num3 > 5 ));then
	echo "$num3 is greater than 5"
fi


#the use of single parentheses in linux includes command substitution, subshell creation, groupings within conditional statements
a) Command substitution
result=$(command)

if ["$result" = "expected_value"];then
	echo "The result is as expected"
fi


b) Create a subshell within a conditional statement. A subshell is a child shell created within the main shell, and it is useful for grouping commands or isolating variables
(command1; command2)
if(command3);then
	echo "command3 succeeded"
fi

c) Groupings and precedence
if [ "$var1" = "value1" ] && ( [ "$var2" = "value2" ] || [ "$var3" = "value3" ] ); then
	echo "Conditions Satisfied"
fi
