#here is what is the use of the tee command
#The tee command is a useful Linux command that allows you to read from standard input (stdin) and write to both standard output (stdout) and one or more files

$ echo "Hello, World!" | tee file.txt
Hello, World!
$ cat file.txt
Hello, World!



#in the case that you want to discard the output from a command you have to redirect the output of the tee to /dev/null
$ echo "This is line 1" | tee > /dev/null
This is line 1
