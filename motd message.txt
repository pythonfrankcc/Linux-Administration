#create a banner motd on linux


#Switch to the root user or use a superuser command such as sudo
#Navigate to the /etc
#Check if a motd file already exists in the directory. If it does, you may want to back it up before making any changes.

#use a text editor eg vi, nano or vim to edit or create the motd message

#this is the message your user will always be welcomed to whenever they log into a linux system
